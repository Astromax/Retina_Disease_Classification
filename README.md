# Retina_Disease_Classification
A computer vision project which analyzes images of human retinas and classifies them according to whether or not they are healthy and, if not, which of several ailments they suffer from.
This project originated with a Kaggle competition, https://www.kaggle.com/c/vietai-advance-course-retinal-disease-detection/overview, in which the objective is to correctly classify retina images according to whether or not they have any of six diseases, or if they are healthy.  There are 3,435 training images, with the following label breakdown: 
opacity - 0, diabetic retinopathy - 1, glaucoma - 2, macular edema - 3, macular degeneration - 4, retinal vascular occlusion - 5, and normal - 6.  
An important note: unlike an ordinary classification problem, in this case a retina may be afflicted with more than one ailment.
